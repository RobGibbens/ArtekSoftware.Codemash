REPORTED ISSUES
When I select the map, I can't get back to the session list. 
I see various crashes. Last one was after I clicked a speakers twitter handle. It launched Safari correctly. I double clicked the home key then selected the app. It crashed. 
I added a session to my schedule. I then removed it, but it was still in the list. If I kill the app then launch again it works. 
I tried a refresh of speakers and it crashed...
